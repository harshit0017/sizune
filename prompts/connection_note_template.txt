Alignment Priority Instruction:
Primary Input:
You are provided with:

(1) The candidate’s resume

(2) The job description (JD)

(3) A detailed Alignment and Reasoning Document connecting the two.

Instruction:

Base the email primarily on the Alignment and Reasoning Document.

Use the resume and JD only for supplementary context if directly relevant additional examples are needed.

Do not invent new skills, achievements, or experiences beyond what is confirmed in the Alignment document or Resume.

Your goal is to create a mail that mirrors the candidate’s match to the company's mission, strategy, and needs, using factual, impactful examples.

Objective:
Write a confident, high-impact email that positions the candidate as a strategic growth partner, fully aligned with the company's next-stage ambitions.
The email must immediately connect the candidate’s expertise to the company's mission, strategic goals, and growth plans, using tangible examples, business-driven language, and outcome-first framing.

The tone should be executive, warm, future-focused, and outcome-oriented — never robotic, generic, or exaggerated.

Detailed Instructions:
1. Hook and Personalization:
Start with a bold, engaging hook that ties the candidate’s interest to the company’s mission and ambition (e.g., "I came across the [Role Title] at [Company] and was immediately drawn to your mission of [specific mission/goal].").

Mention role title and company name within the first 1–2 sentences.

Mirror the company’s ambition using a keyword or strategic phrase from the JD or Company profile (e.g., "scaling to IPO", "AI-driven ecommerce transformation").

2. Role Interest and Strategic Alignment:
Express strong interest in the role — frame it through how the candidate’s expertise will drive the company’s strategic goals.

Mention career background and aspirations that match the company's future growth direction.

3. Strategic Background Fit:
Write a tight, energetic paragraph summarizing industries, products, platforms, and leadership experiences.

Position the candidate as already operating at the future scale the company is aiming to achieve (e.g., IPO readiness, enterprise scaling).

4. Impact-Driven Highlights Section:
List 5–7 high-impact, business-focused achievements using bullet points.

Each bullet must:

Start with a bolded skill or focus area (e.g., AI-Powered CX Automation:)

Describe a project, specific result, and business impact, using quantifiable metrics wherever possible (e.g., "reduced cloud costs by 25%", "improved user engagement by 30%").

Tie the achievement directly to a key company need or future goal (e.g., scaling, automation, ARR growth).

5. Vision Alignment:
Add a strong alignment paragraph linking the candidate’s passions, leadership style, and aspirations to the company’s 2–3 year vision (e.g., "expanding into multi-product SaaS leadership", "scaling AI sales platforms", "preparing for IPO").

6. Action Statement:
Confirm that the candidate has already applied through the portal (if applicable).

Express eagerness to have a conversation about how they can drive the company's goals.

Politely request forwarding the email if the recipient is not the correct contact.

7. Closing:
End with a polished, confident closing (e.g., Warm regards, Best regards).

Include candidate’s full name, email address, and phone number.

Tone and Style Guidelines:
Executive voice: Write like a peer helping a peer, not a subordinate asking for a chance.

Business-first framing: Focus on outcomes, scale, growth — not just duties and responsibilities.

Concise and dynamic: Keep paragraphs 2–4 lines max — no walls of text.

Impact and metrics: Where possible, show specific metrics (e.g., 500M bookings/day, 30% revenue growth, 25% cost savings).

Warm and human: Stay approachable — avoid stiff corporate jargon or buzzword stuffing.

Future-focused energy: Show excitement about helping the company achieve their future goals.
