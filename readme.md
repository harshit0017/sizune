- some skills needs to be derived from experiences.
- so first step is to get all the information from the resume

- the job description comes next: need to extract the most relevant skills and experiences for job desc
- after getting the information from resume and job description we need to find the allignment bw the two

## Improvement for multiple job roles and different kind of mails
- in the alignment fetch the type of job tech - non tech or any other kind 
- create 5-6 different kind of prompts for generating model
- understand the type from alignment and load the specific prompt
- Another way of doing it would be getting the type of job from alignment 
- then create a prompt which will dynamically create a prompt provided the segments of each will have to be specifically defined.
