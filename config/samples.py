Built for Shopify and powered by advanced ecommerce integrations, Gorgias's conversational AI understands your brand, tools, policies, and customers to drive personalized, 1-to-1 conversations — from editing orders and initiating returns to making product recommendations. Gorgias, where every customer interaction feels personal, support becomes sales, and conversations shape success.

TL;DR: Ecommerce merchants spend $2b per year on their support team. Gorgias is building a Conversational AI that drives sales and automates CX for merchants. We’re currently at $70m in ARR and the goal is to get to $200m by 2027. What's in it for you? Take a company to IPO while being a member of the exec team and owning the whole engineering team. We're at 100 engineers today, we're growing the team 50% next year and the goal is to aim for 250m ARR in 4 yrs.

We’re building a conversational AI that drives sales and automates CX for merchants

We are uniquely positioned to lead the development of Conversational AI. As a customer service company operating in the transactional space of ecommerce, our goal is to build an AI that not only automates support but also drives sales and streamlines internal tasks for merchants.

Today, we empower merchants to succeed and grow by offering a conversational AI that automates CX requests and boosts sales across all channels. We’ve built the #1 helpdesk for Shopify, with an AI that automates customer experience (CX). Over 15,000 brands, including Timbuk2, Steve Madden, and Mr. Beast, rely on us daily. Read customer stories here.

We believe in empowering entrepreneurs to push commerce forward. By supporting commerce, we’re contributing to an industry that employs the most people globally and sustains millions of jobs.

We bring all customer conversations into one place, leveraging their unique data to automate tier-1 support and free up teams to focus on driving revenue and building customer loyalty.

Customer experience is at the heart of everything we do. Today, this means focusing primarily on support, but we are also expanding our efforts to include product discovery and sales.

For our engineering team, success means empowering merchants to deliver exceptional customer experiences through a stable, fast platform that leverages AI to automate conversations, reduce support costs, and drive revenue for brands.
