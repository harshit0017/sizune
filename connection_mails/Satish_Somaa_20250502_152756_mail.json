  "mail_content": "Hi, I came across this Director of Application Modernization position at Scotiabank; while doing my research, I believe you're likely the hiring manager. Seeing a strong alignment, I thought I'd reach out to you directly.\n\nI see you are looking for someone to lead application modernization and development initiatives. At Cognizant, I spearheaded the Cards Product roadmaps for Capital One Financial Services, driving efforts in application development, modernization, and migration initiatives. This included migrating 60% of legacy card functions to cloud platforms, which resulted in a $10M revenue boost and a 30% reduction in AWS cloud costs. I\u2019ve also driven the adoption of DevOps and Agile practices, boosting deployment frequency by 60% and improving application delivery efficiency by 20%.\n\nPreviously, at Capgemini with Discover Financial Services, I implemented business solutions that reduced BIN usage by 43% and improved accuracy by 50% through innovative software solutions and real-time monitoring. My experience in leading cross-functional teams and managing large-scale projects aligns well with the strategic goals of Scotiabank.\n\nI am accustomed to operating in complex environments, having led Agile teams and coordinated efforts with banks, merchants, and third-party vendors. My experience spans across financial services, working with companies like BNP Paribas and Wells Fargo, which has equipped me with a deep understanding of the industry.\n\nIf you open my resume, you'll see a striking resonance in what you're looking for. I have already applied to this position and would love to have a quick conversation if you're still hiring!\n\nBest,  \nSatish Somaa  \nsatish.c.soma@gmail.com  \n(503) 473 6497  "
